% Problem statement:
    
%     The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
% 
%     What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

% Note: Prime Factors is currently a list. Replace with a set if your only 
% interest is in unique prime factors. 

% Note: Function currently remembers all prime factors. Can change this to 
% look for only the largest factor.
