# Project_Euler_Solutions
Repository Containing Solutions to Project Euler problems. https://projecteuler.net/archives

I'm using this primarily to practice using Erlang. 

If this repository ever begins to start solving questions from outside 1-100, I will make this repository private, in the spirit of Project Euler. 

In any case, people reading this repo should really not be reading it to find out how to solve project euler problems (however, if you're interested in how I personally use Erlang to solve them, then feel free to look! :) )
