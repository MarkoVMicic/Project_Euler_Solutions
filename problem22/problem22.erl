% Problem Statement: 
% Using names.txt, a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, 
% begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the 
% alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical 
% position in the list to obtain a name score.

% For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which 
% is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN 
% would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

% What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
